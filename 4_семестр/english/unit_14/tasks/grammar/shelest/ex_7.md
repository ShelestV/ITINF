<h1>Answer</h1>
If you are <em>interested</em> 
in the life of birds you should know that birds do not <em>usually</em> 
fly very high and we can <em>easily</em> see them 
flying from the ground. A lot of birds when on <em>migratory</em> 
fly from 100 to 400 metres high as the <em>equipment</em> shows. Some 
birds, like penguins, cannot fly, but they are good <em>swimmers</em> 
and good <em>jumpers</em> too. 
They <em>quickly</em> jump into and 
out of water and they look so <em>fun</em> when they walk.
