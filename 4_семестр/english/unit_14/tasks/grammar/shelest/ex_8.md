<h1>Answer</h1>

The English language is <em>constantly</em> growing and 
changing. No one has ever included every word from the language in a single dictionary. To do that would mean to <em>write</em> 
the dictionary every day, which is <em>impossible</em>. 
But people have a lot of <em>information</em> 
about the <em>growing</em> 
and <em>developing</em> 
of the language, its <em>expanding</em>. 
Scholars have <em>varied</em> ideas of how any new 
discovery contributes to the process of new words <em>adopting</em>. 
When people are faced with a new <em>situation</em> 
and they do not have a word for its <em>describing</em> they sometimes 
make up one. But no one makes a formal <em>decision</em> about it. 
Many <em>readers</em> begin to have trouble when they start 
to read passages about <em>familiar</em> subjects. 
Such people often <em>understand</em> the passage as they cannot tell 
what the <em>meaning</em> of the sentence is. 
They come across <em>known</em> words which prevent 
the process of <em>comprehension</em>. There are 
many <em>useful</em> ideas that can help you and the first is, 
“Don’t get <em>nervous</em>. 
Try and read the passage <em>attention</em>, learn from context. 
Pay <em>attention</em> to what the rest of the passage says. 
English has a very <em>efficient</em> 
method of adding words <em>borrowed</em>! 
As an English <em>speaking</em> travels the globe he adds a wealth 
of words from other languages. By the 1600’s the English were <em>actively</em> 
involved in <em>explore</em> 
They were looking for countries to establish trade <em>connecting</em> 
with. In those countries a <em>travelling</em> 
was exposed to new ideas, climates full of heat and <em>ice</em> 
cold, <em>different</em> 
plants and animals. Rather than make up <em>ended</em> 
rows of new words for everything he saw, an <em>exploration</em> often used the words of the natives. These 
words became an <em>important</em> part of the English vocabulary.
