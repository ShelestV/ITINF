A programming language is, in many ways much like the languages we use <ins>to communicate</ins> with each other. A
programming language <ins>establishs</ins> a special set of rules and a vocabulary that have to do with a computer’s
operation. Before communication with a computer can be <ins>initiated</ins>, the rules and specialised vocabulary of
the programming language must <ins>be known</ins> to both the computer programmer and the computer itself. A
programming language has words, symbols and rules of grammar (known as the syntax of the
language). A computer programmer, <ins>providing</ins> within the structure of these rules, develops an instruction <ins>guiding</ins>
the computer’s operation. The resulting set of instructions is the computer program. Often these
instructions <ins>tell</ins> the computer what to do when the user of the program <ins>operates</ins> some kind of action
(when, for example, the user <ins>type</ins> in characters from the computer’s keyboard). Over the years,
computer programming methods <ins>evolve</ins> through the development of successive ‘generations’ of
programming languages, with each new generation bringing new functionality and ease-to-use.
