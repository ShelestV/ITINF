<h1>Answer</h1>
1. Programming languages are classified as first-, second-, third-, fourth-, or fifth- generation languages, according to when they were developed and how sophisticated they are.
2. The first- and second-generation languages are very difficult to use and are considered low-level languages.
3. High-level languages represent a higher level of abstraction from a machine code than do assembly languages.
4. Programming with a machine language requires writing out the binary values of the program instructions.
5. Assembly languages are the first to use alphanumeric symbols to write a code.
6. They are called high-level languages because they represent a higher level of abstraction from a machine code than do assembly languages.
7. A compiler converts an entire program written in a high-level language to machine language, storing it in what is called executable file, to be run later at the user's discretion. An interpreter reads each high-level program statement, then translates it to machine language and instructs the computer to execute the statement immediately.
8. BASIC, PASCAL.
9. This group of languages includes object-oriented languages, application generators, authoring systems, HyperTalk, and query languages.
10. Yes, it is. (Natural languages)
11. Query languages are used specifically within the realm of databases.
12. Natural languages.
